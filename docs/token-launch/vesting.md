# Vesting

**Available now** for launches made by script through a TokenFactory. **Not offered on the launch form.**

A TokenFactory launch can create vesting in the **same transaction** as the token. The factory deploys a vesting wallet clone and funds it with a percent of supply.

The **Launch** tab does not do this. A launch from `/launch` goes through the CurveLauncher, which mints the whole supply onto the bonding curve and creates no vesting wallet. When a launch starts from a token design that declares team vesting, the form says so: the schedule stays a published commitment in the design and is not applied on-chain. See [Enforced versus stated](../ideation/enforced-vs-stated.md).

Tokens that were launched with vesting show a vesting card on [the token page](token-page.md).

## Parameters (contract path)

| Parameter | Range |
|-----------|--------|
| Vested percent | 1-100 (integer) |
| Duration | 1-3650 days |
| Cliff | 0 or more days; cannot exceed duration |

`startTimestamp == 0` in the contract path resolves to `block.timestamp`. The **resolved** start is what gets emitted in events.

## How addresses work

Vesting clone salt is derived from the **token address** (`keccak256(abi.encode(token))`), not from the launch user salt alone. That keeps vesting addresses collision-free even when a userSalt is reused across factory versions.

## Ownership and release

- The vesting **beneficiary is the Ownable owner** of the wallet (OpenZeppelin v5 pattern). Ownership can be transferred (including selling unvested positions). Always read live `owner()`, do not freeze the event's beneficiary forever.
- `release(token)` is **permissionless** and always pays the current owner.

## Events

- `TokenLaunched` is the same whether vesting is used or not.
- Vesting details live in a separate `VestingCreated` event.
