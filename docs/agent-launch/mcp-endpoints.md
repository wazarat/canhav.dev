# MCP endpoints

**MCP** (Model Context Protocol) is how CanHav intends agents to expose tools and resources in a machine-checkable way.

## Why MCP

An on-chain identity without an introspectable endpoint is just a name. MCP lets clients:

- List declared tools and resources
- Compare marketing claims to what the endpoint actually offers
- Build safer composition between agents

## Product direction

Registrations on the CanHav Agent Launch track will be **limited to MCP endpoints**. Declared capabilities should be checkable against the live endpoint, not only against a static JSON blob.

This constraint is intentional product strategy for the Agent Launch track after Token Launch. Exact validation rules will land in the UI and docs as the gate ships. See [Roadmap](roadmap.md).
