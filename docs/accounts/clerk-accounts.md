# Accounts (Clerk)

**Available now.** CanHav accounts use **Clerk**.

## Sign up and log in

Sign-up is open to everyone, with an email address. Create an account at [canhav.com/sign-up](https://canhav.com/sign-up). The **Log in or sign up** button in the navigation opens `/studio`, where existing accounts log in and new ones can follow the link to sign up.

## Accounts and wallets are separate

Your CanHav account and your wallet are two different things.

- The **wallet** signs on-chain actions: launching, buying, selling, and creator actions on a token.
- The **account** owns your studio records: projects, token designs, and the launches recorded to it.

Connecting a wallet does not sign you in, and signing in does not connect a wallet. On-chain actions through CanHav need both: you sign in first, then the wallet signs.

A launch is recorded to your account the moment its transaction confirms, so it appears in the studio. A token launched before sign-in was required, or one whose link did not complete, can be claimed from its token page with the wallet that created it.

## What requires an account

- Launching a token, buying and selling, and creator actions on a token page (pools, sales, escrow and progress updates)
- Creating and editing project and token design drafts in the [studio](../ideation/studio.md) (`/studio`)
- Publishing and unpublishing those drafts
- Linking a project to a token design
- Seeing your launches in the studio and [linking a launch to a project](../token-launch/projects-and-launches.md)
- The agent prompt for a launch, a project's own MCP server, and its agent-write setting
- Markdown export and the `get_my_` MCP tools for your own designs and launches (see [AI and IDE](../ai/export-and-mcp.md))

## What does not require an account

- Reading research on [canhav.com](https://canhav.com)
- Reading published docs on [docs.canhav.com](https://docs.canhav.com)
- Exploring launched tokens
- Reading public token, project and token design pages (`/launch/t/...`, `/p/...`, `/t/...`)
- Reading public data over the shared MCP server

## What data is stored

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Account identity (via Clerk) | Authenticate studio owners (`owner_id` on drafts) |
| Draft project / token design documents | Autosave and edit |
| Publish snapshots and slugs | Public pages (insert-only snapshots) |
| Optional link rows between project and token design | Cross-links |
| Optional attach of deployed token address to a design | Connect design to on-chain launch |
| Launch records | Which account a launch is recorded to, the creator address read from the chain, and the project it is linked to |
| Agent change records | What an agent proposed or wrote on a project, when its owner allows agent writes |
| Project file references | Pointers to your own files that you add to a project. Never published |

CanHav does not need your private keys. Do not paste seed phrases into any CanHav form.

Exact retention and deletion controls will be documented when account management is production-ready.

## Cost

Accounts and the studio surfaces described here are **free**. There is no paid tier documented for these features.
